# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This application is created to provide an internet retail company a back end for their e-commerce website that allows them to view products, update their products, add new products, and delete products in order to compete with other companies in their industry. 

## Software

This application was created using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MySQL, MySQL2, and Sequelize with Visual Studio Code, as well as Insomnia.

## Application

The user needs to acess a database and begins the process by adding their database name, and MySQL username and password to an environment variable file. Then the user runs the schema file to create the database, and then runs the seeds to complete the database. At this time the user can start the application by opening up Insomnia. The user can run GET routes for categories, products, and tags, and that is to find all or find by id. In addition, the user can run POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in JSON format to respectively create, update, or delete categories, products, and tags.
